(* LISTS *)

(* Implement a function that would return the 
   2nd last element. If only one element exist,
   return than element. For example:

(* Implement a function that would return the
   first element in a list that satisfies a given predicate
   For example:

   construct a list of all prime numbers in that range.

(*
   Goldbach's conjecture says that every positive even number greater 
   than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. Example: 28 = 5 + 23. It is 
   one of the most famous facts in number theory that has not been proved 
   to be correct in the general case. It has been numerically confirmed 
   up to very large numbers. Write a function to find the two prime 
   numbers that sum up to a given even integer.
   For example:
      goldbach 4 ==> (2,2)
      goldbach 8 ==> (3,5)
*)

(* TREES *)


type 'a tree = Leaf of 'a | Node of 'a * ('a tree) * ('a tree)

let bt1 = Node (1,(Leaf 2),Node (3,(Leaf 4),(Leaf 5)));;

(*
   Write a function that would count the number of leaves
   in a given binary tree
   For example:
     countL (Leaf 0) ==> 1
     countL (Node(0,(Leaf 0),Node(0,Leaf 0,Leaf 0))) ==> 3
*)
let rec countL (t:'a tree) : int =
  -1
;;

countL bt1;;
(* val countL : 'a tree -> int = <fun> *)
(* - : int = 3 *)

(* 
   We can flatten a tree into a list in prefix fashion
   by putting value at node, then values of left subtreee,
   followed by values of right subtrees.
   For example:
     prefixBT (Node(4,Leaf 1, Leaf 2)) ==> [4;1;2]
*)

let rec prefixBT (xs:'a tree) : 'a list =
  []
;;

prefixBT bt1;;
(* val prefixBT : 'a tree -> 'a list = <fun> *)
(* - : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5] *)

(* 
   We can flatten a tree into a list in infix fashion
   by putting values of left subtreee, value at node,
   followed by values of right subtrees.
   For example:
     infixBT (Node(4,Leaf 1, Leaf 2)) ==> [1;4;2]
*)
let rec infixBT (xs:'a tree) : 'a list =
  []
;;

infixBT bt1;;
(* val infixBT : 'a tree -> 'a list = <fun> *)
(* - : int list = [2; 1; 4; 3; 5] *)

(* A tree is perfectly balanced if either it is a leaf
   or it is a node with two subtrees of the same height and also
   perfectly balanced. Write a function that takes a height
   value and then returning a perfect tree of that height with 
   all its elements set to 1 
  For example:
    perfectTree 2 ==> Node (1, Leaf 1, Leaf 1)
*)
let perfectTree n =
  Leaf (-1)
;;

perfectTree 3;;
(* val perfectTree : int -> int tree = <fun> *)
(* - : int tree = Node (1, Node (1, Leaf 1, Leaf 1), Node (1, Leaf 1, Leaf 1)) *)



(* HIGHER-ORDER *)

(* 
   Given two lists, return a list of all possible
   pairs of the two lists.
   For example prod [1;2] [`a;`b] would
   return [(1,`a);(1,`b);(2,`a);(2,'b)]
   Use higher-order List.map to help you in this task.
*)

let rec prod (xs:'a list) (ys:'b list) : ('a * 'b) list =
  []
;;

prod [1;2] [`a;`b;`c];;
(* val prod : 'a list -> 'b list -> ('a * 'b) list = <fun> *)

(* polymorphic rose tree *)
type 'a roseTree = 
  | NodeR of 'a * (('a roseTree) list)

let rt2 = NodeR (1,[NodeR (2,[]);NodeR (3,[NodeR(4,[])]);NodeR(5,[])]);;

(* 
   We can flatten a rosetree into a list in prefix fashion
   by putting value at node, followed by values of each 
   of the subtrees.
   Implement a first-order version of this prefixRT
   method without using any higher-order functions.
   For example:
     prefixRT (NodeR(4,[NodeR (1,[]); NodeR (2,[])]))  ==> [4;1;2]
   Below is a first-order implementation.
*)

let rec prefixRT (xs:'a roseTree) : 'a list =
  match xs with
    | NodeR (x,lrt) -> x :: comb_prefixRT lrt

and comb_prefixRT (xs:('a roseTree) list) : 'a list =

(* 
   write a higher-order counterpart for prefixRT 
   Use higher-order function List.fold_right to help
   you in this method.
*)

(* 
   We can denote rose trees as strings of the following form: 
    "a(b(d,e),c,f(g))".
   Write an OCaml function which generates such a string representation
   for rose tree.
   You are to use a higher-order function pr_args below
   which prints a list of items separated by comma.
